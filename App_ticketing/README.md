## Setting Up Python Environment and Running Scripts

If you encounter issues with pip or need to recreate your virtual environment, follow these steps:

### Resolving pip Command Not Found

If you encounter the "pip command not found" error, follow these steps to resolve it:

#### Step 1: Ensure Python and pip are Installed

Check if Python and pip are installed by running:

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

If pip is not installed, proceed to install it.

#### Step 2: Install pip

For macOS/Linux, download get-pip.py and run the script with Python:

```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py
```

#### Step 3: Activate Your Virtual Environment

Navigate to your project directory and activate your virtual environment:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

#### Step 4: Install Required Packages

Install necessary packages within your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python python-dotenv
```

#### Step 5: Run Your Script

After installing packages, run your script:

```bash
python3 pj.py
```

### Recreating Your Virtual Environment

If you need to recreate your virtual environment, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Remove the Existing Environment

Deactivate the current virtual environment (if active) and remove it:

```bash
deactivate
rm -rf myenv
```

#### Step 2: Create a New Virtual Environment

Create a new virtual environment in the same directory:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

#### Step 3: Activate the New Virtual Environment

Activate the new virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Step 4: Install Required Packages

Install required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 5: Run Your Script

Run your script:

```bash
python3 pj.py
```

### Optional: Create a requirements.txt File

Generate a requirements.txt file for future installations:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Summary

Follow these steps to resolve pip issues and recreate your virtual environment, ensuring your Python environment is set up correctly for running scripts.
